# Statement

I will NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY if anyone copies this code to his own assignment.

##

This directory contains Matlab codes for the stability and sensitivity analysis of 
channel flows, Poiseuille and Couette flows. These are parts of the tutorial: 
"Analysis of fluid systems: stability, receptivity, sensitivity" by Peter Schmid and
Luca Brandt, published in Applied Mechanics Reviews.

The codes include comments that make possible to follow their structure. A file
description is included in each function. Information about the codes and functions
and list of parameters can be displayed using the "help" command.

The main programs are

TransientGrowth.m    : compute the transient growth curve G(t)

OptimalDisturbance.m : compute the optimal initial condition and the corresponding flow response

Neutral_a_Re.m       : compute the maximum optimal growth and the least stable eigenvalue in the Reynolds-alpha plane

Neutral_alpha_beta.m : compute the maximum optimal growth and the least stable eigenvalue in the alpha-beta plane

Resolvent.m          :  compute the resolvent norm for real and complex frequency omega

NumRange.m           :  compute the spectrum and numerical range of the stability operator

OptimalDisturbance_luca.m : compute the optimal initial condition and the corresponding flow response 
          and displays the optimal initial condition and optimal output in terms of u,v,w, not v and eta!!
